big files divided into blocks 
block size in Hadoop 128 Mb
suppose 500 mb file how will we divide


DATANODE holding actual data
4 blocks  128 block 1
          128 block 2
		  128 block 3
		  116 block 4 
		  
		  
		  
		  
		  
		  
		  
		  
		  
Named Node 
		
		holding metadata of data stored 
		
		file  1 block 1 datanode 1
		file 2 block 2 data node 2
		file 3 block 3 data node 3
		file 4 block 4 data node 4
		
		named node is like index page telling where what is kept
		
named node is heart of hdfs

in this case 4 node hadoop cluster

can goes beyond 4000 nodes without any ?issues
why the block size is 128 mb? 
 
the less block size it will be more parallelism . but if we reduce block size too much it ll overburden named blocks

what if we make block size is too big then less parallelism. but its actually good size maintaining parallism and no overburdening named nodes

admin can change block size

when ur datanodes actually grows our metadata in named data also increases . so in newer version of hadoop we have namednode federation to give scalablity from namedode
 perspective aswell
its introduced in newer version of hadoop.
so that we don't get scalablity from datanodes but also from namednode

to ensure data safety we have data replication by default its 3.Admin can change

when named node fails secondary node come in pic . secondary node come in pic. secondary namenode is for fault tolerance
namednode federation is for scalablity . so that named node doesnot get overburden with metadata

rack - is a group of servers kept at different geographic location . so that if one rack goes down other rack are still up and working


if you want to install hadoop 
we can manually intall hdfs,mapreduce,hive ,yarn which is actually not developers task.i need a cluster up and running.


you need a readymade vm.vm is virtual machine

cloudera quickstart vm where things are preinstalled 

oracle virtual box- you can installl the cloudera vm
pseudo  distributed code
namenode and datanode is running on same vm
ur system ll get very slow n u ll not get fill of peroduction environmemt

in production multinode cluster

multinode cluster - fully distributed cluster (seprate named node, data note and gateway)
                     pseudo distributed (named dode and data note in same machine)

linux command
pwd - present work directory - in linux by default its home directory		 
whoami - tells usename
linux follows a tree like structure denoted by  / forward slash- in linux we says directory in windows folder
cd - change directory
ls -l - showcasing all 
cd~ - TO TAKE ME TO MY HOME DIRECTORY

CD .. - TO GO BACK IN PARENT DIRECTORY
cd -   to go back to previous directory
cd ../.. - it will take me two directory back
cd . - current directory
clear - clear the screen
cd / data - where lot of data

how to go from  data/trendytech to data/retail - cd.. /retail

absolute path / relative path

absolute path means from root bhow to go
relative means from where we are currently how to go

ls command 
===================
it is for listing files and directories

blue color directories
green executable file
black color normal file
=================
if i press up arrow it will give the last commam=nd

ls-l
==============
it shows permission , when created size

ls -lt newest file first
ls -ltr  oldest file first
ls -l gives ascending order based on diictionary
ls -lr gives descending order based on diictionary
ls -R recursively prints all files and folder
ls -a - all hidden files  start with .
ls - Ra/aR - RECURSIVELY PRINT ALL FILES INCLUDING HIDDEN FOLDERS
ls -ltaR - LONG LISTING BASED ON TIME Hidden files recursively
how to create empty file


touch is use to creste empty 

file - touch filename
rm filename will remove file
chmod 777 filename (rwx owner rw group ,1 others)

cat - is to see the content
mkdir is use to create directory
rmdir to remove directory only ewhen if its empty
if the directory is not empty 
rm -R Directory name to forcefuly delete the directory 
cp command is used to copy files and diictionary

cp file 1 file 2
cp file 1 dir 2
cp is like copy paste
 cp file1 dir2
 cp dir3 dir2 (will not work ).we have to do it recursively
 cp -R dir3 dir 2 (it will work)
if in same directory then how to move within directory then cd directory name

mv command 
=======================
mv command is used to move file from one directory to another or to rename file
mv filename  newfilename
mv filename1 directory name1 (it ll move filename1 to directoryname 1)


==================
to create file with content
vi file name 
press i button on keyboard to insert mode
then write content 
press esc
shift +:
wq (w for save q for quit)
head part -00000
cat part-00000
will show 1o line
head -5 filenametoread
tail
will show 1o line
tail -5 filenametoread
------------
cat /data/retail_db/orders/*

/* to show all files


history - to show what all commands are run
wc to give line count word cou nt and charactercount
wc samlefile

with cat command also we can create and type in file
cat > sampletext and save using ctrl +d
creating two files with data and merging to a new file
cat data1.txt data2.txt >>merge.txt
cat file1
cat >file1 (open for writing)
cat >> file2 (for appending)

===============
du is for disk usage
$du /data/trendytech
$du -h /data/trendytech(give result in human readable form in gb ,mb,kb)
=======================
for search grep data(keyword to be searched) *
