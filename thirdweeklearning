local AGgregation is called combiner  - combiner runs at Mappefr - outpot of mapper is given to combiner
combiner is working exactly the same as reducer . but on small set not on entire set
use combiner with a caution 
 when we talk about max , min and sum using combiner or without combiner the result will be same which is correct .
but when we apply combiner on average it can change result so think before using combiner
more work at mapper
less data transfer at network
improves parallelism
